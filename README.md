PrivAlign: A Privacy-Aligned Mentor-Mentee Architecture for LLMs.

PrivAlign is a novel framework for privacy-preserving large language model (LLM) alignment. 
It introduces a modular architecture where a locally deployed mentee model autonomously handles user queries 
and escalates uncertain ones to one of several mentor models, each trained with differential privacy guarantees in transformed semantic domains.


üõ†Ô∏è Sample Code
See mentee.py for a runnable Python simulation of the architecture. It includes:

Confidence-based escalation

Domain transfer + reverse

PPO ‚Üí KPO ‚Üí PPO transformation logic

Mentor selection and DP tracking

bash
Copy
Edit
python mentee.py
Output will show:

KPO label conversion

Chosen mentor response

Final decoded output

Cumulative privacy budget usage
